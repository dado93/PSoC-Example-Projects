# HCSR04 Project

This project allows to test a HCSR04 ultrasound sensor with a PSoC microcontroller.
The HCSR04 sensor is an ultrasound sensor that can be used to measure distances in the 
range between 2 and 400 cm. You can find its datasheet [here](https://www.mouser.com/ds/2/813/HCSR04-1022824.pdf).

The timing diagram of the HCSR04 pins (Trigger and Echo) is shown in the following figure:

## Included projects
The project actually includes three different projects, each one with increased
level of difficulty.

- Base Project: in this base project, all the operations to control the HCSR04 sensor and
the measurements are performed in the infinite for loop.
- Medium Project: in this medium project, the trigger operation is done in the infinite for loop, while the 
measurement is done in a separate ISR triggered by the echo pin.
- Advanced Project: in this advanced project, the 10 micro-second pulse on the trigger pin is
generated by a PWM component triggered by a timer. The measurement of distance is done in a ISR.

## Requirements

- PSoC Creator version 4.2. 
- PSoC microcontroller 5LP version
- HCSR04 sensor
