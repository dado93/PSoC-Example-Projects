# LED Driver Project

This project shows different ways of controlling a simple LED with a push button. In addition to this,
it also shows how to control a RGB Led. The included project are very simple, and are intented to
be shown to the student of the course in the very first class on PSoC micro controllers.

## Included projects
The project includes five different projects:

1. **Design 01**: very simple project showing CPU control of a LED through a push button.
1. **Design 02**: very similar to project in **Design 01**, with the only difference that when the push button is pressed, the LED switches ON/OFF alternatively.
1. **Design 03**: PWM control of a LED.
1. **Design 04**: this project shows how to use a Timer to control a LED with a ISR.
1. **Design 05**: RGB Led control with header and source file, showing how to build a very simple driver for a component.

## Requirements

- PSoC Creator version 4.2. 
- PSoC microcontroller 5LP
- HCSR04 sensor
