# PSoC Example Projects
This repository contains some example projects that I created using a PSoC 5LP. The projects were developed using the [CY8CKIT-059](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy8ckit-059-psoc-5lp-prototyping-kit-onboard-programmer-and) development kit and PSoC Creator as IDE.
