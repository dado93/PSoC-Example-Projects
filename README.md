# PSoC Example Projects
This repository contains some example projects that I developed as a teaching 
assistant of the course [Electronic Technologies and Biosensors Laboratory](https://www4.ceda.polimi.it/manifesti/manifesti/controller/ManifestoPublic.do?EVN_DETTAGLIO_RIGA_MANIFESTO=evento&aa=2018&k_cf=225&k_corso_la=471&k_indir=BTE&codDescr=052378&lang=EN&semestre=1&anno_corso=2&idItemOfferta=137485&idRiga=230332) 
at the Politecnico di Milano university (Milan, Italy). 


The projects are intented to explain to the students how to use a PSoC 5LP microcontroller and its IDE, PSoC Creator.
In particular, we used the [CY8CKIT-059](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy8ckit-059-psoc-5lp-prototyping-kit-onboard-programmer-and) development kit.

## List of projects:
- [Led Driver](): project showing different ways of controlling a simple LED
- [HCSR04](https://github.com/dado93/PSoC-Example-Projects/tree/master/HCSR04): project showing how to measure distance using an ultrasound sensor (the HCSR04)
- [MPU9250](https://github.com/dado93/PSoC-Example-Projects/tree/master/MPU9250): project showing how to use the I2C communication protocol and to read accelerometer and gyroscope
values from the MPU9250 IMU

## Future projects:
- ST HTS221
- ST LPS25H
- Sensirion SHT7x and SHT85
- ADC measurements
- DMA
- UART
