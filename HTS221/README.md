# HTS221 Project

This project shows how to interface with a [HTS221](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/hts221.html) temperature and
relative humidity sensor with a PSoC 5LP using I2C communication.  

In this project, I would also like to implement some software design patterns for embedded systems that I'm learning while reading the 
book [Making Embedded Systems](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920017776.do)

If you do not have the equipment to solder a HTS221 sensor, which comes in a tiny 2 x 2 x 0.9 mm package, I would suggest you to get a breakout board, such as the [STEVAL-MKI141V2](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-mki141v2.html).

## Requirements

- PSoC Creator version 4.2.
